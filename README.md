# Marlin Firmware for Dobot.
## Synopsis
It's a part of my graduation design about a robot control system. Marlin firmware is a open-source 3D printer firmware. 
Source code see [Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin)
## Description
I have modified some interface to make it suitable for a Dobot type robot arm in the laboratory, including 
Descartes coordinate system designating, polar coordinate switching, deviation fixing, etc. See comments in Marlin_main.cpp.
